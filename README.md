Tired of job applications asking for the same link over and over again? Wish you could have them all in a single, easy-to-access location?

Introducing Linkt! A chrome extension I created to serve as a single source of truth for all the links in your life! Using chrome localstorage (so I won't be storing your data), enter your links once and copy these links to your clipboard with a single click of a button.

Features:
- Spots for popular platforms such as Email, Linkedin, Github, Personal Website and more!
- 4 personalized links
- Additional colour scheme

You can find/install the extension here! :')
